  Welcome to my site! 

  I am Yorgos Chatizhteoklitos a scientific software engineer in one of the biggest data science companies in London.

  I work in the research data science team, so my work is really varied. At the moment I am building an executable in C++ that does forecasting, and building a website with interactive documentation.

  I did my masters at Imperial College London, where I learned parallel computing, machine learning and optimisation.

  In my free time I climb, cycle and cook !
