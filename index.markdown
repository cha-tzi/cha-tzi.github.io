<p>
  Welcome to my site! 
</p>
<p>
  I am Yorgos Chatzitheoklitos a scientific software engineer in one of the biggest data science companies in London.
</p>
<p>
  I work in the research data science team, so my work is really varied. At the moment I am building an executable in C++ that does forecasting, and building a website with interactive documentation.
</p>
<p>
  I did my masters at Imperial College London, where I learned parallel computing, machine learning and optimisation.
</p>
<p>
  In my free time I climb, cycle and cook !
